#  The Beatles - Come Together
Artist(Band):The Beatles

```
Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

Here come old flattop. He come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs. He's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please

Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

He wear no shoeshine he's got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger he shoot Coca-Cola
He say "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now over me.

Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

He buy production he got walrus scumble
He's got Ono sideboard he's got spinal cracker
He's got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his arms till you can feel his disease
Come together right now over me.

He's roller-coaster he's got early warning
He's got muddy water he's got mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together right now over me.

Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

Ow!

[solo]

Come together! Come together! Come together!
[repeat over solo until end]
