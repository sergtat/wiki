_I use my Kreg-Min Pocket Hole Jig quite often but I always forget the settings for different wood thicknesses so I made this little table to look up whenever I'm using my Kreg Mini. There are three measurements that you need. The depth collar adjustment, distance from edge and screw size._

## Kreg Mini Drilling Depth

First you want to adjust the collar on the 2-set drill bit to control the depth of the pocket hole.

## Kreg Mini Jig Position

Next you want to make sure you clamp down the Kreg-Mini the appropriate distance from the edge of the material based on the thickness of the wood you are joining.
